            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
            How did love become love<br>
            I get close, it goes farther<br>
            Sorry I can't get closer<br>
            I'm sorry I'm like this umm, umm<br>
            One you and two moons</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
            Hiding the truth, pretending I'm fine<br>
            I'm hiding in the rain always smiling<br>
            Woo I want an answer<br>
            That I don't think I can find<br>
            I want the next thing</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
            But anything, nothing<br>
            Is like the heart of a person<br>
            Eyes meeting but hearts apart<br>
            So sweet and so bitter</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
            If I give my hand and expect your heart<br>
            My selfishness grows to a flaw<br>
            Filling the void between us<br>
            Filling the heart with more emptiness</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
            Touch of a season passed-by<br>
            Scent of a moment fill both hands<br>
            I stand still before you before me<br>
            I'm okay, not okay</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
            But anything, nothing<br>
            Is like the heart of a person<br>
            Eyes meeting but hearts apart<br>
            So sweet and so bitter</p>
            
            <p><strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
            Ruinous imagination consumes me<br>
            Makes me dream sweeter dreams<br>
            I close my eyes but thoughts of you<br>
            Bring turmoil to night, to you and me, real and dreamy</p>

            <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
            But anything, nothing<br>
            Is like the heart of a person<br>
            Eyes meeting but hearts apart<br>
            So sweet and so bitter</p>

            <p><strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
            Don't want to let go so I let go<br>
            You and me we see together<br>
            Will our eyes ever meet each other<br>
            Don't want to let go so I let go<br>
            You and me we see together</p>
